Remember Robert C. Martin:
	- In software, 80 percent of what we do is called "Maintenance": the act of Repair. 
	- A Class exposes an abstract interface that allows users to manipulate the Essence of the data, without having to know its Implementation. 
	- Respect the Law of Demeter. Avoid Train Wreckages.
	- Handle Exceptions.


Remember OO Concepts:
	- Confine change to interfaces, that capture all business logic. The Getters. 
	- Do not access class variables directly. 

Remember Instrumentation:
	- Real Data is like White Noise. That will capture your system's actual Transfer Function. Coverage.

Remember, Hunter and Westerman:
	- Step 1: New Thinking: Avoid the 7 Value Traps.

Remember John Keegan: 
	- Two forces always: one slow and the other fast.
