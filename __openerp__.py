        (Since 22 April, in Prod)

        For Open Health. Service oriented way of adding Price List Management. 

        Remember Robert C. Martin:
            - In software, 80 percent of what we do is called "Maintenance": the act of Repair. 
            - A Class exposes an abstract interface that allows users to manipulate the Essence of the data, without having to know its Implementation. 
            - Respect the Law of Demeter. Avoid Train Wreckages.
            - Handle Exceptions.


        Remember OO Concepts:
            - Confine change to interfaces, that capture all business logic. The Getters. 
            - Do not access class variables directly. 

        Remember Instrumentation:
            - Real Data is like White Noise. That will capture your system's actual Transfer Function. Coverage.

        Remember, Hunter and Westerman:
            - Step 1: New Thinking: Avoid the 7 Value Traps.

        Remember John Keegan: 
            - Two forces always: one slow and the other fast.
